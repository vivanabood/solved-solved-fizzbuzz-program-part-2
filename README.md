part 2

Modify the FizzBuzz program developed in Week Two to record the user input using an array. The function must have the prototype int FizzBuzz(int, int), where the function takes the row number input from user as the first parameter and the column input amount by the user as secondparameter. Create the function to output the number of guesses user takes until they get a FizzBuzz output.

Replace this code in the body of your program with a switch statement. When the user successfully enters a number that gets desired FizzBuzz ouput, prompt to ask if the user wants to play again.

Include the proper header and make sure you properly comment your program. Also, make sure you use proper coding conventions.
